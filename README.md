# Crop-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting suitable crops based on various environmental factors such as soil type, weather conditions, and other related parameters. The objective is to assist farmers and agricultural planners in making informed decisions to optimize crop yield.The project employs machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training. Key algorithms used in this project include Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The data for the project was gathered from reliable agricultural datasets and includes factors like temperature, rainfall, soil pH, and nutrient content.The model is evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, and recall, and has been fine-tuned to improve performance. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in agriculture, helping to improve farming efficiency and productivity.
